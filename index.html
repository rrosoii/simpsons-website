            I was hesitant to give this the rating I did, but from reading other audience reviews, my review actually will come across as far more...
            lenient. What can I say that hasn't been said already, the golden age of The Simpsons (seasons 3-8) is flawless television. Going through it again, it was
            awe inspiring to me how they manage to structure joke upon joke upon joke upon joke, something that must've been a complete breath of fresh air considering 
            the boring, lifeless, milk-toast...(click to read more)

            OK so many say that this show is slowing loosing it's luster. I beg to differ slightly. Family Guy seems to be the "in thing" right now and though I love that show as well,
            The Simpsons is still the hierarchy or animated television. This show can be enjoyed by all races, religions, and ethnicities alike. It's not as racy as the aforementioned
            competition but still just as (if not more) funny. Things do tend to wear over time and people's likes/dislikes tend to change. I've enjoyed...(click to read more)

            Animated Film or "Cartoons' have long been part of the motion world. Their magical movement and "life" has been the instrument of so much laughter, tears and all round amazement,
            tons of it. From HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES (Vitagraph Co., 1906) right down through the heyday of ROGER RABBIT(1988) and beyond, the animated film has been there
            providing us with an alternate film Universe; another dream world for other dreams. Animated Film or "Cartoons' have long been part...(click to read more)

            I'm sorry but I'm pretty sure it's common knowledge by now the show has been on a decline for years now, but at this point I believe there is more bad episodes than good with a lot 
            of meh sprinkled in. I have watched every episode of this show and will continue to watch so that title stands and I would be lying if I say I didn't enjoy myself for a portion of it.

            Such a classic, funny family with every episode being a whole new story. The characters are well developed, and that is why the show has worked well for so many years. I love this show so much!
             It makes me feel comforted, and I really enjoy the fact that it doesn't require a lot of thought. If I've had a busy day, I can just put an episode on and watch it with ease. The characters and scenarios 
             in this show are just so relatable, and there is a character for everyone! I love all the different personalities, even within the main family. It makes for some really... (click to read more)
